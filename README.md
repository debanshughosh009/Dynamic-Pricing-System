# Dynamic Pricing Model for Indian Railways

This project aims to develop a Machine Learning–based dynamic pricing model for the Indian Railway system. The model is designed to help maximize both revenue and seat occupancy by adjusting ticket prices in real time based on demand, time, and other influencing factors.

# Machine Learning Approach

- **Supervised Learning** using historical ticket data
- Initial model: **Linear Regression**
- Exploring advanced models (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Performance evaluation based on metrics like RMSE and R² Score
